                  <p class="article-text">Nowadays worldwide air-quality monitoring outdoor devices are tracking levels of dangerous particulates in the atmosphere of the cities. According to the World Health Organisation, 90% of people are breathing increasingly polluted air. The most harmful kind, called PM2.5, contains tiny particles small enough to enter the bloodstream through the lungs and that is a problem that contributes to an estimated 7 million premature deaths every year. Unfortunately the plant CO2 consumption does not directly affect PM2.5 particles. This parameter is affecting human health around the world. </p>

              <p class="article-text">Vast majority of city inhabitants spend 90% of the day time indoors according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Indoor pollution is getting worse when air absorbs harmful substances. Statistically in developing countries, the parameters of effects on human health show that indoor air pollution surpasses outdoor air pollution sometimes 10 times. This is happening because the contained areas are fertile environments for the pollutants to build up. Indoor air pollution from solid fuels accounted for 3.5 million deaths and 4.5% global daily-adjusted life year (DALY) in 2010; it also accounted for 16% particulate matter pollution.The household air pollution from solid fuels directly affects Global Burden of Disease ranking of cities around the world( The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) provides a tool to quantify health loss from hundreds of diseases, injuries, and risk factors, so that health systems can be improved and disparities can be eliminated. According to the World Health Organisation in 2016, household air pollution from cooking with solid fuels was responsible for 3.8 million deaths. This makes this risk factor the largest environmental contributor to ill health. The importance of household air pollution as a public health threat varies drastically according to the level of development: in low-income and middle-income countries, household air pollution is responsible for almost 10% of the mortality, while the same risk factor is only responsible for 0.2% of deaths in high-income countries.</p><br>
              <p class="article-text">Improving the air conditions and lowering CO2 emission is one of the primary goals to accomplish on the planetary scale by 2030. Regular activities in households that contribute to increase of harmful substances are: smoking, cooking, cleaning, opening doors and windows in areas where outdoor pollution is high. One of the recent activities within the Urbantech team is a research and a design workshop on this topic. We want to create a system that will allow citizens to maintain clean air and optimal conditions. We will include technologies that include bioengineering and automatisation processes and we are planning on building an algae bioreactor as an air purifier. We believe that building a powerful algae fueled air purifier appliance can make a change.</p><br>

That is why each household might have the best chance to improve life conditions by taking care of air quality and there are numerous studies that suggest what are the best ways to do that.</p><br>
