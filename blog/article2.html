                  <p class=“article-text”>CO2 or carbon dioxide is a gas that is crucial for life on earth. But too much can be detrimental to our health, productivity and well-being. </p>

              <p class=“article-text”>Carbon dioxide is consumed by producers to make glucose. This process, which is named photosynthesis, creates oxygen (O2) as a byproduct. As we all know, oxygen is critical for us consumers, which means carbon dioxide also is. Although carbon dioxide is needed on this planet, too much carbon dioxide is harmful to our health and other aspects of our lives.

              <p class=“article-text”>With a higher amount of carbon dioxide exposure such as 1600 ppm in a longer timespan your body can react by increasing your breathing by 100%. Common effects at 2000 ppm are increased respiratory rate with 50% and brain blood flow. Common effects at 3000 ppm are decreased exercise tolerance caused by breathing resistance. When you meet a level of carbon dioxide of 5000 ppm, it is common to experience e.g., dizziness, dyspnea, confusion and headache. You will most likely increase your respiratory rate by 100% and breathing by 200%.</p><br>

              <p class=“article-text”>Increased amounts of carbon dioxide can also dramatically decrease your performance in decision-making tasks. The increased level of carbon dioxide in the environment rises your focus, meanwhile decreasing your ability to make the right decisions. A study[2] states that “high levels of focus under non-emergency conditions may indicate “overconcentration.” This led to a moderate but significant decrease in six of nine decision-making tasks at 1000 ppm compared to 600 ppm. The quality of performance decreased even more the higher the concentration of carbon dioxide was. At 2500 ppm, seven out of nine tasks failed. This means that your day at the office is not near the potential of productivity it could have been. This could be seen as many hours wasted or worse results than what you potentially could have. </p>

                  <p class=“article-text”>Reducing the amount of carbon dioxide at your workplace, the restaurant, at home where you spend hours and hours a day trying to relax could really show an increase in your mental health. Maybe the reduced stress and headaches will leave you more motivated to get that workout in or have more playtime with your children. At least the time is not wasted on the things you want to do the least but focused on the things you want to do the most.
